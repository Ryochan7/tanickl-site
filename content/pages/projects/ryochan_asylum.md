Project_site_title: Ryochan's Asylum


Personal website powered by various web platforms over the years. It started
as a simple WordPress blog. The data was exported to XML and carried over
to a custom built simple blogging platform made with the Django web framework.
Eventually, a Django powered CMS (Mezzanine CMS) was used to power the website
and allow more project related content on the site. The final iteration
of the website was powered by Druapl 8 using the data exported from
Django to JSON files and then re-created as Drupal nodes. All old data
has been lost since the website last existed.
